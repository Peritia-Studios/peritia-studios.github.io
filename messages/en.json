	"about_journey_text": "<p><span class='text-glowing'>Plebis Online</span> started in probably the most random way possible—during the COVID-19 lockdown. Like a lot of people stuck at home, we were just looking for ways to pass the time. We ended up playing this game called Chaos (it’s on Steam, look it up!) and were having an absolute blast. At some point, one of us joked, “What if we made a game like this?”. And then... we decided to actually do it. The only catch? We were students at the time, so juggling schoolwork and game development wasn’t always easy. But that didn’t stop us. We kept going, kept learning, and slowly got better at this whole game dev thing.</p> <p>January 21st was the day we had the idea. By the evening, we had the whole thing planned out—or at least, we thought we did. None of us really knew what we were doing at first. Our early models were rough, our code barely worked, and the first versions of the game were... well,let’s just say a little rough around the edges. But that didn’t stop us. We kept going, kept learning, and slowly got better at this whole game dev thing.</p> <p>That being said, it wasn’t all smooth sailing. There were phases where we barely touched the game for weeks—sometimes even longer. Life got in the way, motivation dipped, and progress slowed. But no matter what, we always came back to it. After all, it was, is, and will remain a project of heart for all of us.</p> <p>We ended up starting over from scratch four times (yeah, four). Each time, we took what we learned and tried to make something better. It wasn’t easy, but looking back now, seeing how far we’ve come since those early, messy days makes all the effort totally worth it.</p>",
	"about_team": "The Team",
	"about_team_text": "<p><span class='text-glowing'>Plebis Online</span> is the result of a group of students who decided to try their hand at game development during the COVID-19 lockdown. None of us were experts, but we were determined to learn as we went and work together to bring our idea to life.</p> <p> <span class='text-glowing'>Ole</span> was the main developer, responsible for a lot of the frontend work, including designing the new gun models. He took on the role of organizing and leading the team, keeping everything moving forward—even when we had no idea what we were doing.</p> <p> <span class='text-glowing'>Erik</span> helped design the earlier gun models and maps, but his main focus shifted to writing the game’s lore, website texts, and promotional materials. Although programming wasn't his strength, he ensured that the world and story of <span class='text-glowing'>Plebis Online</span> had depth and coherence.</p> <p> <span class='text-glowing'>Nico</span> worked on the multiplayer aspects and backend of the game. He was the one who made sure everything worked online, even if it meant dealing with bugs and issues along the way. Nico was also the one who sometimes pushed deadlines, but his work was key to making the game functional for players.</p> <p> Alongside us were <span class='text-glowing'>Hanno</span>, who created the music and sound design, and <span class='text-glowing'>Nils</span>, who designed this website. Both of them brought their own unique skills and helped shape the experience of the game.</p> <p> We’re just a group of students with a shared interest in gaming, trying our best to make something we can be proud of. It hasn’t been easy, but we’ve learned a lot along the way and are excited to share what we’ve built.</p>",
